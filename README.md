# Advent of Code 2020

This repo contains my solutions for this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

I've coded all of these in Rust, with each solution in their own folder.

## Usage
```
$ cargo build --release
$ /path/to/advent_of_code <day> /path/to/your/input/file 
```

The *input* file is optional, so if you pick a number such as **2**, the input will be loaded from **src/day2/input**.
