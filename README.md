# Advent of Code 2020

This repo contains my solutions for this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

I've coded all of these in Rust, with each solution in their own folder (`day1`, `day2`, etc).

**Don't run the solutions using `cargo`**. Also, you'll have to provide your own input files.
